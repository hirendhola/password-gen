This is a simple and sleek web-based random password generator built using React. It allows you to generate secure passwords with various options such as length, numbers, and special characters.

## Features

- **Password Length Slider**: Adjust the length of the password with a user-friendly slider. Choose any length between 8 and 50 characters.

- **Include Numbers**: Enable this option to include numbers (0-9) in your generated password.

- **Include Special Characters**: You can also include special characters like `!@#$%^&*` for added complexity and security.

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Once you have generated a password that suits your needs, simply click the "Copy Password" button to copy it to your clipboard for easy pasting.

- **Feedback on Copy**: The button label changes to "Copied!!" when the password is successfully copied to the clipboard, providing visual feedback.
